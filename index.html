    <h2>SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.</h2>
        <div id="play">
            <p><span data-actor="LAERTES">LAERTES: My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
                And, sister, as the winds give benefit
                And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
                But let me hear from you.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="OPHELIA">OPHELIA: Do you doubt that?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="LAERTES">LAERTES: For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
                Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
                A violet in the youth of primy nature,
                Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
                The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</span></p>
            <p><span date-actor= "OPHELIA">OPHELIA: No more but so?</span></p>
            <p><span date-actor= "LAERTES">LAERTES: Think it no more;
                For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
                In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
                The inward service of the mind and soul
                Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
                And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
                The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
                His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
                For he himself is subject to his birth:
                He may not, as unvalued persons do,
                Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
                The safety and health of this whole state;
                And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
                Unto the voice and yielding of that body
                Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
                It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
                As he in his particular act and place
                May give his saying deed; which is no further
                Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
                Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
                If with too credent ear you list his songs,
                Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
                To his unmaster'd importunity.
                Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
                And keep you in the rear of your affection,
                Out of the shot and danger of desire.
                The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
                If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
                Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
                The canker galls the infants of the spring,
                Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
                And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
                Contagious blastments are most imminent.
                Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
                Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</span></p>
                <p><span date-actor= "OPHELIA">OPHELIA: I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
                    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
                    Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
                    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
                    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
                    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
                    And recks not his own rede.</span></p>
                <p><span date-actor= "LAERTES">LAERTES: O, fear me not.
                    I stay too long: but here my father comes.</span></p>
